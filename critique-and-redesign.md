# The Beginning

I decided to work on NYC Slice data set. I was drawn to this visualization because it documents an interesting, daily purchase with the rigor of a long-term study. The author didn't just track prices; they compiled a dataset from 464 specific slices over eight years, explicitly excluding dollar slices to refine the average. This approach transforms a simple observation into a concrete record of urban life. As someone familiar with New York City and its food culture, seeing the steady climb from $2.52 to $3.00 for a plain slice validates a feeling I’ve had that the city's most basic needs are dramatically changing. The most compelling details are those observations, like the note on the declining amount of sauce, which suggests a downgrade of quality that a price line alone can't show. It’s a personal archive that uses data to tell a very human story about cost, value, and the slow evolution of a city's character through its food.

Here’s a link to the original data visualization: https://elkue.com/nyc-slice/


# About me
Hi everyone, my name is **Bo**, and I’m currently a first-year **Master of Science in Building Performance & Diagnostics (MSBPD)** student. I graduated from Cal Poly in 2023 with a Bachelor of Architecture and have been working professionally in Sacramento for about two years. I’m also a licensed architect in the State of Illinois. Recently, I decided to shift my career focus from traditional architectural design toward building technology and science, especially in building envelope, waterproofing and vapor proofing, and also to expand my professional network on the East Coast. 

# What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. Maybe I want to make a list of all the things.  If so, I can do so in Markdown like this: 

In this class, I'm really hoping to:

- Learn how to make graphs that don't suck. I want to make charts that are actually clear and helpful, not confusing or misleading.

- Get good at telling stories with numbers. Instead of just showing a spreadsheet of data, I want to be able to create a visual that tells a story like, "Here's why this wall detail will prevent mold."

- Stop relying on just static drawings. In architecture, we live in PDFs. I want to learn how to create dynamic visuals that can make my reports and presentations way more powerful and convincing.
