# Changes made since Part II

### **Reflection on Changes Since Part 2**

**1. Strategic Design Shifts & Usability Improvements**

- **Prioritizing Clarity Over Complexity**: To make the data accessible to casual skiers, technical industry jargon was replaced with intuitive terms (e.g., changing "Vertical Drop" to "Mountain Height"). Additionally, smaller resorts with incomplete data were removed to reduce visual clutter and ensure every data point represented a viable option.

- **Visual Structuring for Comparison**: The timeline bar charts were restructured from an alphabetical sort to a ranking by "Total Days Open." This created a visual "staircase effect," allowing users to instantly identify top performers like Arapahoe Basin without reading every label.

- **Guided Interpretation via Annotation**: To reduce the cognitive load on non-analysts, visual cues were added to the scatter plots. This included shading specific background areas (such as a "Value Zone") and using distinct colors to highlight outliers like Wolf Creek and Loveland, pointing users directly to insights.

**2. From Exploration to Actionable Narrative**

- **Shifting from Exploration to Decision-Making**: The project goal evolved from a static display of general trends to a specific decision-making tool. The focus is now on answering "Where Should You Ski Next?" by helping users navigate trade-offs between cost, snow, and terrain.
- **Persona-Driven Navigation**: Instead of a generic "one-size-fits-all" dashboard, the story branches into distinct paths based on fully realized user stories (e.g., Alex the Weekend Warrior, Sarah the Powder Hunter). This approach uses personas as filters to present the same dataset in different contexts—prioritizing "Drive Time" for Alex versus "Historical Snowfall" for Sarah.

**3. Key Reflections on Data Storytelling**

- **The Necessity of Narrative**: Data alone was found to be "flat." Introducing human dilemmas (like the "Group Planner" or "Weekend Warrior") transformed abstract charts into useful tools. Effective storytelling begins with a human problem and uses data to solve it, rather than starting with data and looking for a problem.
- **Answering the "So What?"**: A critical realization was the need to contextualize metrics. It is insufficient to simply state a number (e.g., 5,000 acres); the design must explain the value proposition (e.g., more acres result in fewer crowds). Every visualization now includes captions connecting the metric to the user's actual experience.


## The audience
**The Target Audience**

The primary audience for this data story is the recreational skier or snowboarder who feels priced out or overwhelmed by the current state of the industry. This group includes budget-conscious locals living in Denver and trip planners trying to organize vacations for groups with mixed skill levels. They are not looking for luxury marketing. They are looking for value, efficiency, and honest data to help them decide where to spend their limited time and money.

**Narrowing the Focus**

To refine the project, I moved away from generic user types and developed three specific data-driven personas based on the analysis in Part 3:
- Alex (The Weekend Warrior): A city dweller restricted by a tight budget and a hatred for traffic.
- Sarah (The Powder Hunter): An expert skier who ignores amenities and only cares about snowfall history.
- Sam (The Planner): The organizer who needs to find a compromise between high prices and good terrain for a large group.
I also incorporated feedback from the user interviews conducted in Part 2. Participants indicated that they felt intimidated by technical jargon and cluttered visuals. This feedback confirmed that the story needed to be simple and approachable rather than purely academic.

**Specific Adjustments**

I made several concrete changes to the final design to better serve this audience:
- Simplifying Language: I replaced industry-specific terms like "Vertical Drop" with "Mountain Size" in the legends. This ensures that a casual skier like the "Planner" persona can understand the trade-offs without needing a technical background.
- Reordering Visuals: In Part 2, the season timeline chart was sorted randomly. For the final story, I sorted the resorts by the total number of days open. This created a clear "staircase" visual that allows the user to instantly see which mountains offer the longest season.
- Action-Oriented Groupings: Instead of asking the audience to interpret a complex scatter plot on their own, I added clear annotations. I highlighted specific zones on the charts, such as "Hidden Gems" or "Tourist Traps." This directly answers the specific questions posed by the personas, such as where to find the most snow for the lowest price.

# Final thoughts
1. The most rewarding part of this project was shifting my mindset. I started as a data analyst trying to show every single number I found. By the end, I felt like a guide trying to help a friend plan a trip. It was satisfying to cut out data that was technically interesting but not actually useful for making a decision. I learned that sometimes the best design decision is just hitting the delete key.

2. If I had more time, I would have loved to integrate live data. The current project relies on historical averages to predict the future. It would be amazing to connect the charts to a live weather feed that updates the "Fresh Snow" numbers in real time. I also wanted to spend more time optimizing the experience for mobile phones. The scatter plots work well on a desktop screen, but they feel a bit cramped on a smaller device.

3. I was most excited about the moment the personas clicked. For a long time, I struggled to make one chart that satisfied everyone. When I finally decided to split the narrative into three distinct tracks for the Budget Skier, the Powder Hunter, and the Planner, the project immediately became easier to manage. It proved that trying to speak to everyone usually means you end up speaking to no one. Narrowing the focus made the data stronger.

5. Reflecting on the journey as a whole, I have to admit that I often wished the course load was a bit easier. Balancing the deep data collection, the technical analysis, and the design iterations was intense. However, looking at the final result, I can see that the rigorous pace is exactly why I learned so much. The pressure forced me to master the tools quickly and think critically about every design choice, leaving me with skills I know I will use in the future.
