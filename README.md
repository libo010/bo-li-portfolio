# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. :)

# About me
Hi everyone, my name is **Bo**, and I’m currently a first-year **Master of Science in Building Performance & Diagnostics (MSBPD)** student. I graduated from Cal Poly in 2023 with a Bachelor of Architecture and have been working professionally in Sacramento for about two years. I’m also a licensed architect in the State of Illinois. Recently, I decided to shift my career focus from traditional architectural design toward building technology and science, especially in building envelope, waterproofing and vapor proofing, and also to expand my professional network on the East Coast. 

# What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. Maybe I want to make a list of all the things.  If so, I can do so in Markdown like this: 

In this class, I'm really hoping to:

- Learn how to make data visulizations. I want to make charts that are actually clear and helpful, not confusing or misleading.

- Get good at telling stories with numbers. Instead of just showing a spreadsheet of data, I want to be able to create a visual that tells a story like, "Here's why this wall detail will prevent mold."

- Stop relying on just static drawings. In architecture, we live in PDFs. I want to learn how to create dynamic visuals that can make my reports and presentations way more powerful and convincing.
